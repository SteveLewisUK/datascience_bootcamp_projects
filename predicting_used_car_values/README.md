### Objectives
'Rusty Bargain' is a used car sales service.  In order to attract new customers, it wished to develop an app for customers to quickly find out the market value of their car.

The objective of this project was to train a number of models to predict car values.  The models were to be evaluated according to:
- The time required for training
- The speed of the prediction
- The quality of the prediction.
