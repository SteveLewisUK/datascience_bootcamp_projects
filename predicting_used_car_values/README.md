### Objectives
'Rusty Bargain' is a used car sales service.  In order to attract new customers, it wished to develop an app for customers to quickly find out the market value of their car.

The objective of this project was to train and compare a number of models with various hyperparameters to predict car values.  In particular to compare gradient boosting methods with Linear Regression (as a sanity check), Random Forest Regression and Decision Tree Regression.  The models were to be evaluated according to:
- The time required for training
- The speed of the predictions
- The quality of the predictions (the RMSE metric was used to evaluate the models).
