### Objectives
The online store *Ice* sells video games worldwide. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. The company wished to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow it to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.

The objective of this project was to carry out a preliminary analysis of historical data on game sales. It is December 2016 and the company was planning a campaign for 2017.<br />
