# datascience_bootcamp_projects
A selection of projects I worked on during the Practicum by Yandex Data Science bootcamp. 

There must be a README.md file containing the repository structure in the root of the repository. 
The structure should include projects, brief descriptions of them, and an indication of what each folder contains.

| Markdown              | tables                 | can be                      |
| :-------------------- | ---------------------: |:---------------------------:|



|     aligned left      |     aligned right      |      and centered           |
